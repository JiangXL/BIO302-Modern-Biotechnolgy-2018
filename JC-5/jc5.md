# Plasma Proteome Profiling to Assess Human Health and Disease
> Yuejian Mo, 11510511

For a doctor, he can diagnose patients' health state from the
special protein level. Most typical method we used is using
single-protein immunoassays. But immunoassays can not deal with
the isoform protein. Also, if we use Mass spectrometry to track
the proteomics, it will be difficult to handel the high dynamic
range of proten abundance. So they found a method, which only cost
about 3 hours to profile plasma proteome. Firstly, they collect
5μl blood to get 1μl plasma. Then, plasma are scaled up by 
automated machine. The HPLC will generate the raw data from 
sample. Finally, after data analysis, the level of protein can
be draw out. Althoug this method can collect lots of plasma
proteome data in short time, the key information of speical kind
of protein are still rare. So, it will be a time for its large-scale
use in biomedicine.
