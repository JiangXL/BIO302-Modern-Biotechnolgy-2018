The advent of microscopy 

Kinde
resolution
priciple of light microscopya
	+ phase contrast
	+ chemical stains
	+ what is fluorescence
		+ Quantum yield
		+ jablonskim diagram
			+ life time the time on sub-statablity 
			+ stock shift
		+ extinction coefficent
	+ smaill molecuess-pros/cons

Obtaining sharper images I: deconvolutionn microscopy
Obtaining sharper imaged II: confocal microscopy
	laser focus same as image focus

The use of microscopy in biology
	+ Limits of resulution
	+ eva... wave
SIM
	+ resulotion --> sub100nm
	+ > fouries transfer
STED 	
	+ 50nm xy 
PLAM	
	+  point to image
	+  every time random exitce
	+ Localization, not resolution
	+ long time
