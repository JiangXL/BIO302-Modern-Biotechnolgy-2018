# Mciro- and nano-mechanics of osteoarthritic cartilage: The effects of tonicity and disease severity
> 11510511, Yuejian Mo

Osteoarthritics(OA) is a type of joint disease that results from 
breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common 
symptons are joint pain and stiffness. OA is characterized by the loss of 
proteoglycans(PGs) and hence glycosamainoaglycans(GAG) content via
enymes as well as failure of the collagen network and subsequently loss of
cartilage stiffness. To discover the mechanical function of GAGs and 
collagen fibers. They major use the nanoarthritic to get the micro- and 
nano-scale mechanic profile of OA cartilage. Finaly, they found that the 
micro- and nano-scale mechanical of OA dependent on the tonicity of 
medium and stage of disease. Experiments results suggests that the
sensitivity of mechanical properties vanish as GAGs lose.
