# Using computational modeling to design new antivirals
> Yuejian Mo, 11510511

Influenza is a major public health threat, but here are low efficacy of
seasonal flu vaccines and increasing in drug-resistant. To develop new
drug to against influenza, scientists found a antibodies to bind to a highly
conserved region on viral hemagglutinin, which can prevent from a wide range
of diverse influenza. However, current vaccines vary on strain and is low
efficiency to against the drifted or shifted strains. Then D.H Fuller etl.
optimized one of HA stem binding protein to tight binding using computational
modeling. Finally, new designed protein show the ability to disrupts different
influenza.
