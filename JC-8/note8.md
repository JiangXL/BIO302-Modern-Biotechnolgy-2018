# _De novo_ protein design
> Yuejian Mo, 11510511

Investigate the protective efficacy of a protein computationally
designed to bind with high affinity to the same region in the HA
stem. We show that intranasal delivery of HB36.6 affords protection
in mice lethally challenged with diverse strains of influenza independent
of Fc-mediated effector functions or a host antiviral immune respone.
This designed protein prevents infection when given as a single dose
of 6.0 mg/kg up to 48 hours before viral challenge. A single dose
of 10.0 mg/kg HB36.6 administered 1-day post-challenge resulted in
substantially better protection than 10 doess of oseltamivir administered
twice daily for 5 days. Thus, binding of HB36.6 to the influenza HA stem
region alone, independent of a host response, is sufficient to reduce
viral infection and replication in vivo. These studies demonstrate the 
potential of compuationally designed binding proteins as a new class
of antivirals for influenza.
