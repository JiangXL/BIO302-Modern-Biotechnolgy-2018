# A Photoactivable GFP for Selective Photolabeling of Proteins and Cells
After change the sequence of WEGFP, Lippincott-Schwartz get PA-GFP, which
increase fluorescence 100 times when excited by 488nm light after 413nm light.
PA-GFP is stable and restrict with acid, which can be used to exploring
intracelluar protein dynamics.

# Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans
This papse use a intersting method to measure the fat cell generation over
servel year. It is a good exmple of pulse-chase.
