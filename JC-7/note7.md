## A system for the continous directed evolution of biomolecules
Traditionly, the evolution of many biomelecules involed long time and heaveay
human intervention. More the number of rounds derfomed, the more evolution 
can produced. Based on the work of Wight and Joyce, scientists can continue
evolved RNA ligase ribozymes in vitro. Now(2011), Esvelt, Carlson and Liu 
develop a method called PACE. PACE system directed evolute gene-encoded 
biomolecules in vivo(_Escherichia coli_). To show the effectiveness of PACE,
they evlved T7 RNA polymerase to bind a distinct promoter. After 200 rounds over
8 days, the T7 RNA polymerase activity enhanced hundred-fold.

PACE contribute a method to rapidly generate biomolecules with new activities 
in a **living system**, which will be make sence to syntheic biology.
