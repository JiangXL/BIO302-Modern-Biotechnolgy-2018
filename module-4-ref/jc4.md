## Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory

Refering from wikipeida, **memory** is the faculty of the mind by which
information is encoded, stored, and retrived. When we learn new thing, new
synpase form and a population of neuron are actieved, which can be called
information encode and are thought to store within the hippocampla-entorhinal
cortex (HPC-EC). Over time, short-term memories transformate to long-term
memory(remote memory). For decases in neuroscience, the most widely accepted model
posited that short-term memories form rapidly in hippocampus and are later
transfrom to long-term memory in HPC-EC. During uncovering the nature and 
dynamics of process, they found a different model.

Susumu Tonegawa use lots of technogy. I hight light optogentics here.
They installed channelrhodopsin-2 to MEC-Va cell, PFC engram cell and
DG engram cell. Then these cell can be triggered precisely by light, which
involved the behavior of memory.

Finally, they found the evidence that new memories form at both
location at the same time.
