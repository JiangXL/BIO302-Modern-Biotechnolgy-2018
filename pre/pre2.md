# Micro-and nano-emchanics of osteoarthritic cartilage: The effects of tonicity and disease severity

The contribution o f GAGs and collagen fibers to the mechanical properties of
OA cartilages tissue. 
+ EPIC-muCT confirm that mild OA specimens had significantly higher GAGs content
compared to sever OA specimens.
+ In micro-scale, the semi-equilibrium modulus of mild OA significantly dropped
after immersion in a hypertonic solution and at nano-scale, the histograms of the
measured elastic modulus revealed three to four components.
+ Represent the mechanical properties of GAGs and the collagen network

Our observations support the assocaition of the third peak with the collagen network.
However, our results did not provide any direct evidence to support the association
of the first peak with GAGs.

A change in the response of OA cartilage to hypertonicity, likely collagen damage,
as the disease progresses to its latest stages.
