## Expansion Microscopy
In this article, Prof.Boyden and his students invent a total different
method to improve the optical imaging. They tried to magnify the specimen
rather than enhancing the structure of microscope. Firstly, they injected the
chemistry sodium acryalte and comonomer acrylamide and
N-N'-methylenebisacrylamide into cell or brain tissue. Then water were
added into specimen, which enlarged specimen. By this way, they can use a normal
microscope to observe finer structure. With some experiments, they proved 
that ExM is receivable microscopy. They summaried following advantage:

- Fast speed to image than SIM
- Under diffraction-limited microscope, but similar voxel size of a superresolution microscope.
- Enable bigger volum of specimen to image
- Empower fast method, just like light-sheet microscopy

It is a pity that they can't observe alive specimen, whose dynamical
process encodes lots of information. 

## Deacetylation of Nuclear LC3 Drives Autophagy Initiation under Starvation
Autophagy is a self-digestion of cell, which can maintain homeostasis. 
However, startved cells can upregulate autophagy to recycle nutrients.
In this paper, authors used the method of FRET and other method to find
out the temporal-spatial control of LC3 activity, which play a central
role in autophagy.

## Extracelluar rigidity sensing by talin isoform-specific mechanical linkages
For organ development and function, adhering and sensing different stiffness
are very important. However, the mechanisms of detecting extracellular matrix complicance
is still mystery. Authors found talin linkages can exposed to 7-10 pN during cell
adhesion. After a series expments, they found talin is nessary for adhering 
and talin can focal adhesion reinforcement and extracelluar rigidity sensing.
