# A Photoactivable GFP for Selective Photolabeling of Proteins and Cells
Researchers need a high optical contrast, with high stability under a
number of conditions, photoactivable marker in living cells.
After optimize the sequence of WEGFP, Lippincott-Schwartz lab get 
PA-GFP, which increase fluorescence 100 times when excited by 488nm 
light only it is lightedy by intense 413nm light. Because PA-GFP can 
transfer to aninoic form from neural form with 413nm light-GFP, which 
changes the highest absorbance. Aurthos tested that PA-GFP can work 
better than EGFP under low pH enviroment and lysosomes in long time. 
The photoactable PA-GFP can be used to track the intracelluar protein 
danynamcially, which will provide a new "selsective marker" in temporal 
and spatical for devlopment biology.

This papse use a intersting method to measure the fat cell generation 
over servel year. It is a good exmple of pulse-chase.
